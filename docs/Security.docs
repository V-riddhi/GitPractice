Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack

How it Happens:

A hacker secretly intercepts communication between you and a website or app, stealing data like passwords or credit card info. This usually happens on public Wi-Fi.

How to Fix It:

Disconnect from the internet.

Change passwords on a secure device.

Use a VPN for protection.


Prevention:

Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.

Always look for HTTPS in website URLs.

Use two-factor authentication (2FA).


Real-World Example:

In 2015, hackers intercepted messages from users of Orange, a French telecom company, to steal banking details.
